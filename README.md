# desi-emulators-pipeline

This repository contains the files and scripts necessary for training neural network emulators on the NERSC supercomputer. There are three folders `Effort`, `Capse`, `ACE` each containing Julia codes, job scripts, supporting files and notebooks.

Important: Many of the settings listed in the current versions of the codes/job scripts are not final/optimized fully (things like the number of training samples, emulator hyperparameters, slurm job settings may need to be adjusted depending on the accuracy/time constraints for the user training the emulator). It is recommend to start out by training an emulator with fewer samples to ensure that everything works and then proceed to larger cases.

## Installation

First, we must create an environment which permits the use of PyCall within Julia. `cd` to your preferred directory and run the following steps:

1. 
```
module load python
conda create -n classy_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate classy_env
pip install numpy scipy cython
pip install classy
pip install git+https://github.com/marcobonici/velocileptors_free.git
```
2. Run ```which python``` and copy/paste the folder path (will be needed later).

3. Open a new terminal and clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/jgmorawetz/desi-emulators-pipeline.git`.

4. `cd` to the folder `desi-emulators-pipeline`, and run the following steps. In the line `ENV["PYTHON"]`, paste the directory path that was copied from step 2.
```
module load julia
julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.add("PyCall")
ENV["PYTHON"] = <which-python-folder-path>
Pkg.build("PyCall")
exit()
```

5. To install the remainder of the necessary packages, run the following commands (the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files needed are already located in the folder):
```
julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
exit()
```

### Julia codes

#### data_generation.jl
This script generates samples prior to the training process (inputs are cosmological parameters and outputs are the statistics). The existing code is tailored to the mnuw0waCDM extension but it can be generalized to any model of interest. Here are instructions for how to modify the script to accomodate any model:

1. `pars` lists the cosmological parameter labels in the order which will be passed as input to the emulator. `lb` and `ub` denote the lower and upper bounds (for the latin hypercube) associated with the parameters. The boundaries should be wide enough to accomodate the parameter regions of interest but not unnecessarily wide as this degrades emulator accuracy.

2. `n` specifies the number of training samples. This will vary depending on the desired accuracy of the emulator balanced with increased training resources.

3. `seed` specifies the random seed used for generating the latin hypercube sampling. This is merely for reproducibility purposes and can be set to `nothing` if no seed is wanted.

4. The three lines below `s = EmulatorsTrainer.create_training_dataset(n, lb, ub)` filter out unphysical samples (w0+wa>0). Because of this, the actual number of training samples will be less than `n` in practice. Note that the indices 8,9 are currently tailored for mnuw0wacdm so these indices will have to be changed manually depending where w0,wa are found in the input vector (or removed altogether if w0,wa is not part of the model)!

5. `root_dir` is the directory where the training samples will be stored. The directory should be in your scratch folder as there are a large number of files stored. The title for the folder should ideally be labelled with the code/model/number of training samples (not a requirement, but important for preventing overwriting or confusing different emulators).

6. The emulator output k grid `kv_target` was selected to provide sufficient resolution (for interpolation purposes) across different scales but not unnecessarily high as this reduces emulator accuracy. The resolution is chosen to get coarser at higher k to avoid contributing disproportionately to the cost function. However, the choice is completely arbitrary and the user is welcome to modify as desired.

7. Inside the `velocileptors_script` function, the `cosmo_params` dictionary contains the various parameters that need to be specified in Class. Currently, only the parameters (ln10As, ns, H0, ombh2, omch2, Mnu, w0, wa) are allowed to vary freely. The user needs to free up/fix certain parameters depending on which model is desired. E.g. if the neutrino mass is fixed, swap `"m_ncdm" => CosmoDict["Mnu"]` with `"m_ncdm" => 0.06`.

8. NOTE: To avoid issues with interpolation, we have modified the original `velocileptors` repository (to `velocileptors_free` which is installed in the environment) to allow the freedom to pass our own k grid manually (the original code sets logarithmic spacing by default), so the line calling `EPT.REPT` uses slightly different arguments than original velocileptors.

9. Currently, the emulator computes the power spectrum without the AP effect incorporated (sets apar=aperp=1 in the code), so the AP must be applied analytically in your theory code (Effort.jl has the necessary functions to do this). But if desired, the AP can be reincorporated by calculating the AP parameters and applying them to the line `PT.compute_redshift_space_power_multipoles_tables`.


#### training.jl
This script performs the training itself after the data generation has finished. The existing code is again tailored to the mnuw0waCDM extension but it can be generalized to any model of interest. Here are instructions for how to modify the script to accomodate any model:

1. NOTE: The function `preprocess` applies a rescaling to remove degrees of freedom that are easy to incorporate analytically in a separate step and thus improve emulator accuracy. E.g. for the linear matter power spectrum component, the statistic is divided by $A_s D(z)^2$ and then remultiplied by this after the emulator prediction is made.

2. The function `get_observable_tuple` takes in the cosmology parameters and the full power spectrum result and outputs the tuple of the parameters and the relevant component of the power spectrum. This is tailored currently to mnuw0waCDM, and the user needs to adjust if a different model is used. E.g. if neutrino mass is fixed, `Mν = cosmo_pars["Mnu"]` -> `Mν = 0.06` and remove the entry `cosmo_pars["Mnu"]` from the tuple as it is no longer an emulator parameter. However, the set of parameters that are passed to `preprocess` within this function must remain the same so the existing parameters must be kept (even if they are made to fixed values). In the returned tuple, however, only the free emulator parameters should be listed and they should be listed in the same order as the emulator input.

3. `df` initiates the dataframe which holds the parameters and the outputs. It is currently tailored to mnuw0waCDM and parameters must be removed/added depending on which parameters are allowed to vary by the emulator.

4. `array_pars_in` is the list containing the parameter labels that are passed to `df`. The user must adjust this to ensure they are the same.

5. NOTE: The inputs and outputs are normalized between -1 and 1 (based on the minimum/maximum values of the inputs and outputs) for emulator purposes and then are unnormalized at the end when the emulator prediction is computed. The minimum and maximum values are thus saved to file in advance.

6. `NN_dict` initializes the neural network architecture. It reads in the file from the path `nn_setup_path` (which is one of the arguments passed to the job script) which contains the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, etc. The user needs to adjust these parameters beforehand depending on what their desired settings are. The current settings are not necessarily optimal and are simply placeholders.

7. Several blocks of code copy the various supporting Effort.jl files (bias combinations, jacobians, stochastic terms, postprocessing) to their necessary folders within the trainer emulator directory. These files are already located in the folder Effort/supporting_files and the user is already running the code from the directory `desi-emulators-pipeline` so there should be no issues. (CAUTION: most of these files can remain unchanged; a key exception are the `postprocessing.jl` and `postprocessing_loop.jl`, and analagous .py versions, where the rescaling requires the user to specify the index corresponding to the ln10As parameter in the input parameter vector, e.g. currently it is the second entry in the input vector so the Julia and Python files use [2] and [1] respectively. The user will need to adjust this is they decide to switch the order of the parameters in the input vector).

8. `lr_list` specifies the different learning rates that the minimizations successively iterate through (and there are multiple runs for each). The user is free to vary these as well as the other hyperparameters that are passed to the job script such as batchsize, the number of epochs, the number of runs, etc. These will vary depending on the desired accuracy from the user balanced with emulator accuracy.

9. NOTE: The `weights.npy` files are continuously saved away to the emulator folder as the test loss continues to improve. This is what Effort.jl later reads in when initializing the emulator and calculating predictions.


### Job scripts (submitted directly from terminal)

#### data_generation.sh
This is the first job script the user should run. It runs the code found in `data_generation.jl`. The slurm settings may need to be adjusted (e.g. account, qos, job name, time, number nodes, ntasks per node, memory, etc). Currently, the settings request all cores available on a single node (given that the full node is charged under the current qos=regular setting). The other parameters should be set appropriately based on this. Additional, the folder paths for `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH` and `JULIA_PROJECT` must be changed by the user for their own environment (the latter is set to the `desi-emulators-pipeline` folder). Other aspects of the script can be changed if the user deems necessary. Ensure in advance that the chosen directory name for the emulator training set folder does not already exist otherwise it will cause an error. NOTE: After the data generation job is completed, run `rm .dataset_metadata.json` in the outer folder containing the emulator results. This additional file is unnecessary and should be removed to avoid causing problems for the training code.

Once ready, the user simply runs: ```sbatch Effort/job_scripts/data_generation.sh``` from the `desi-emulators-pipeline` folder.

#### training.sh
This script is the second script the user should run. It runs the code found in `training.jl`. The slurm settings may need to be adjusted similar to the previous script. Unlike the previous script however, this version uses array jobs to submit a separate job for each multipole/component pair, and also allocates multiple cpus per task for each (parallelizes the batchsize). The user needs to adjust the latter by modifying `cpus-per-task` as desired – there is some overhead time associated with the parallelization so the boost in performance is more noticeable the longer the emulator training takes. The memory `mem-per-cpu` and allocated time `time` may also need to be adjusted depending on the emulator in question. The user needs to modify `home_dir` and `scratch_dir` to match the directory where their environment is cloned to and where the training samples are stored. They also need to modify `path_input` and `path_output` to the appropriate input folder from the data generation script and the desired output folder. IMPORTANT: The user must `mkdir` the output path in advance before running this script, and the user must `mkdir` three subfolders: `0`,`2`,`4` (where the data for each multipole is stored) within this outer folder. Then within each of the `0`,`2`,`4` subfolders, the user must further `mkdir` three subsubfolders for each: `11`,`loop`,`ct` (where the linear, loop and counterterm emulator information will be stored). Note these steps can alternatively be added to the job script if preferred. Lastly, the user can adjust the hyperparameters such as number of epochs, number of runs and batchize depending on the desired training settings.

Once ready, the user simply runs: ```sbatch Effort/job_scripts/training.sh``` from the folder where the script is located.

## Capse (CMB angular power spectra)

### Julia codes 

#### data_generation.jl
This script generates samples prior to the training process (inputs are cosmological parameters and outputs are the statistics). The existing code is tailored to the mnuw0waCDM extension but it can be generalized to any model of interest. The instructions are very similar to those for the Effort emulators with a few changes:

1. Complete the same steps 1-5 from the Effort version. The only difference is that redshift is no longer a free parameter and the optical depth tau is introduced as an additional parameter for the mnuw0waCDM model. Parameter orderings and associated boundaries change accordingly. The folder path should also be adjusted since it is for a Capse class emulator not Effort velocileptors anymore.

2. Step 7 is the same as from Effort, but with the `classy_script` function replacing the role of `velocileptors_script`. The `cosmo_params` dictionary again contains the parameters needing to be specified in Class. In this case, the parameters (ln10As, ns, H0, ombh2, omch2, $\tau$, Mnu, w0, wa) are allowed to vary freely. And the user will need to modify this if a different model is used.

3. NOTE: The current calculation goes up to lmax=10000 to be conservative since users may require their emulators to go up this high. If it is not required, however, the user is free to adjust the lmax (in the `cosmo_params` dictionary and in the line `cosmo.lensed_cl`) accordingly which will speed up the code.

4. NOTE: The `TT`, `EE`, `TE` and `PP` statistics are saved to file for each training sample. The user is welcome to change this if only certain components are needed for their purposes.


#### training.jl
This script performs the training itself after the data generation has finished. The existing code is again tailored to the mnuw0waCDM extension but it can be generalized to any model of interest. The instructions are very similar to those for the Effort emulators with a few changes:

1. The function `preprocess` applies a rescaling to remove degrees of freedom that are easy to incorporate analytically in a separate step and thus improve emulator accuracy. In the case of the CMB angular power spectra, the statistic is divided by $A_s e^{-2\tau}$ (since that controls the amplitude) and then remultiplied by this after the emulator prediction is made.

2. The function `get_observable_tuple` is analagous to the version for Effort and takes in the cosmology parameters and the Cl result and outputs the tuple of the parameters and the Cl result rescaled by the factor. This is tailored currently to mnuw0waCDM (but with the addition of $\tau$ as a parameter), and the user needs to adjust if a different model is used. Otherwise, the same rules apply for this step as for Effort version.

3. Steps 3-6 are the same as for the Effort version but with CMB settings instead.

4. Step 7 is similar but this time it is only postprocessing files `postprocessing.jl` (and analagous python version). Similar to the Effort case, the rescaling requires the user to specify the indices corresponding to the ln10As and $\tau$ parameters in the input vector, e.g. currently, it is first and sixth entries. The user will again need to adjust these if they switch the order of parameters in the input vector.

5. Steps 8 and 9 are the same as for the Effort version.


### Job scripts (submitted directly from terminal)

#### data_generation.sh
This is the analogous script to the data_generation.sh job script from Effort. It runs the code found in `data_generation.jl` but for Capse instead. Note that the CMB statistics are more computationally demanding and require more memory and runtime to complete the data generation. But NERSC has a memory limit for a single node, so the user will need to adjust the settings to fulfill these criteria (may require using more than a single node, and it may not be possible to use all the available cores in the node due to the memory limit). Currently, the settings are sufficient for a smaller training sample size of 10000. Otherwise, follow all the same steps for the analogous Effort version (including making sure the folder path for the trained emulator does not already exist).
